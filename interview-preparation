What is call stack in javascript?

The call stack in JavaScript is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in the order they are executed, serving as the mechanism JavaScript uses to manage execution context. 
It is part of the JavaScript engine and plays a crucial role in function invocation and execution.The call stack operates on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
The last function added to the stack is the first one to be executed and removed.
